# Saberfetch
A simple BSIPA plugin that displays system statistics and information for debugging mods or modcharts. This mod is fairly primitive and in early stages of development

## Dependenceies
BSIPA ^4.2.0

## Plans/Todo
- [x] Make the Saberfetch window togglable
- [x] Add modular UI config (In userdata)
- [x] Display current prefabs in scene (Done but expensive)
- [ ] Section for Beat Saber specific things (note count, current song, current environment, etc.)
- [x] Show current scene
- [ ] Display more per rendering counters other than FPS
- [ ] Rewrite UI in BSML
- [ ] Add custom refresh times

## What if I want to compile this mod?
I used Visual Studio 2022 and [BeatSaberModdingTools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Zingabopp.BeatSaberModTemplates) to create this mod. However Rider should work with compiling the mod.
